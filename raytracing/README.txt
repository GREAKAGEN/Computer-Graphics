The project raytracing is running on Visual Studio 2019.
Please open the raytracing.sln on Visual Studio and run it. 

It will apear a line of interaction:
"please select a mode: 0--parallel  1--perspective:"
Here if you select 0, it will render a parallel camera view picture. Othewise it will render a perspective one.
The picture has name "outshade_final.ppm" in fold "raytracing".

The second line will apear after you enter 0 or 1, as:
"Do you need a serious of continuous pictures? 1--YES  0--NO";
If you choose 1, it will render 100 continuous pictures. You can change the value of variant "num" to define how much pictures you want.
If you choose 0, the program will terminate.
Fold "pic" is a serious a picture I rendered before to make the animation.
